Exo-plore App for NASA Space Apps Challenge

Our application blends advanced 3D rendering and AI-driven conversational capabilities to create an interactive and educational platform focused on exoplanets. This innovative app allows users to explore information about exoplanets through a virtual telescope and engage in dynamic Q&A sessions.

Key Features:

1-3D Telescope Visualization:
Utilizing React Three Fiber, the app delivers an immersive 3D experience, featuring a realistic telescope model. Users can visually interact with the telescope as it showcases exoplanets, enhancing engagement and understanding.

2-Exoplanet Exploration:
Users can learn about specific exoplanets by selecting them from a detailed catalog. Each exoplanet is linked to its discovering telescope, providing a rich context for exploration.

3-AI-Powered Q&A:
Through generative AI technology, users can ask questions related to the exoplanets and receive insightful answers directly from the "virtual telescope." This conversational capability is powered by cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) tools and a vector database for efficient information retrieval.

4-RAG Implementation:
The app employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to ensure accurate and contextually relevant responses. Technologies include:

LangChain for managing AI workflows.

Pinecone for vector-based search.

OpenAI embeddings for semantic understanding of text.

ChatGPT for generating intelligent, user-friendly answers.

This application serves as an educational tool, offering users a unique way to explore and learn about exoplanets and the technologies used to discover them. By merging 3D visualization with AI-driven interactivity, the app inspires curiosity and fosters a deeper appreciation for space exploration and astronomy.
